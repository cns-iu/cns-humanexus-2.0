## Overview

This short animation is both an exciting journey through the human body and a vivid showcase for some of the fascinating data and imagery generated by the Human Reference Atlas (HRA). After a brief homage to some of the great anatomical drawings of the past, our journey begins at the level of the adult human body. From there, we move through increasing levels of magnification—zooming in by powers of 10—to view the anatomical structures, functional tissue units, cells, organelles, ribosomes, and amino acid chains that become visible at each new level. As we move to magnification strengths that have only recently become technologically possible, the human anatomy we encounter appears even more strange and wondrous. In the end, we zoom back out to the familiar body view, but we arrive there with an awareness of the amazing worlds that exist within the multiscale human body.

## Sponsor

Human Reference Atlas construction is funded by the NIH Common Fund through the Office of Strategic Coordination / Office of the NIH Director under awards OT2OD033756 and OT2OD026671.

# Data

## Early Anatomical Drawings

[Anatomical images](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1wgK6cJWuPYzvcREmwT7O8XKep8pMsjnS) from the *Notebooks of Leonardo da Vinci*.

## FTU Images

[Extracted images](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1U59da-zREHxIQsuy1CMMXTsmOgSiymjB) from the multipanel figures in scholarly publications made available by the National Library of Medicine (NLM). 

## 2D FTUs

A functional tissue unit (FTU) is the smallest tissue organization that performs a unique physiologic function and is replicated multiple times in a whole organ. Functional tissue unit illustrations may be used to explore cell type populations by gene, protein, and lipid biomarkers in the [Functional Tissue Unit Explorer](https://apps.humanatlas.io/ftu-explorer/) application. The 2D FTUs can be downloaded from the [HRA Portal](https://humanatlas.io/2d-ftu-illustrations) in different formats.

## 3D GLB Files

The HRA 3D Reference Object Library provides anatomically correct reference organs. The organs are developed by 3D medical illustrators and approved by subject matter experts for organs. The organs can be downloaded from the [HRA Portal](https://humanatlas.io/3d-reference-library) in the [GLB format](https://www.khronos.org/gltf).


# Code

## FTU Images Extraction

Parsed NLM publications and extracted 821,642 images related to [22 FTUs](https://humanatlas.io/2d-ftu-illustrations?releaseVersion=2.2). Vision LLM was used to classify images into
- statistical images
- microscopy images
- schematics images
- 3D structure diagrams
- chemical structure diagrams
- mathematical expressions

These multipanel images were then separated into around 400k single pane images using a simple Canny algorithm of edge and contour detection using OpenCV library. The code for this is available at this [Github](https://github.com/cns-iu/cns-humanexus-2.0/tree/main/2.PubMed%20Extract%20Script). These images were later used to create visualizations and animations of Spheres ([Code](https://github.com/cns-iu/cns-humanexus-2.0)), Mosaics ([Code](https://github.com/cns-iu/cns-humanexus-2.0/tree/main/3b-Mosaic)), and a grid ([Code](https://github.com/cns-iu/cns-humanexus-2.0/tree/main/3a-Grid)).

## NLM Book Images

*Hidden Treasure: The National Library of Medicine* contains images along with information from where they are sourced by artists around the world throughout decades. These images were extracted and used for telling a story in this project about human body evolution. You can find the [code for the script here](https://github.com/cns-iu/cns-humanexus-2.0/tree/main/1.NLM_extract_script).

## Images of the Week

HuBMAP (The Human Biomolecular Atlas Program) features an image each week from one of their funded research groups. Four images, all from 2025, appear in the animation:
1. The [3D map](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1h5KcDTwdarBs7bNgf_staNMSKB1N_8kg) of multiscalar neurovascular connections between nephrons of the human kidney across the lifespan from Dr. Sanjay Jain, Liam McLaughlin, and Dr. Gloria Pryhuber (see McLaughlin et al. 2025).
2. The 3D, 50x light sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) [image](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1h5KcDTwdarBs7bNgf_staNMSKB1N_8kg) of an adult human kidney cortex from Dr. Sanjay Jain and Liam McLaughlin (See McLaughlin et al. 2025).
3. The CODEX [image](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1h5KcDTwdarBs7bNgf_staNMSKB1N_8kg) of the small intestine from Joanna Bi and Dr. Bei Wei.
4. The Cell DIVE [image](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1h5KcDTwdarBs7bNgf_staNMSKB1N_8kg) of organ mapping antibody panel-22 for skin from Dr. Fiona Ginty, Liz McDonough, and Christine Surrette from GE Research.

## HRApop Helios

The Cell Similarity Network was created using [Helios-Web](https://heliosweb.io/docs/api/), a web-based library for visualizing dynamic networks in real-time.  This data can be downloaded from the [GTEx Portal](https://gtexportal.org/home/downloads/adult-gtex/single_cell). Shown is open-access data for the adult human from the [GTEx V9 release](https://gtexportal.org/home/downloads/adult-gtex/single_cell).
