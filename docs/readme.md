## Overview

This short animation is both an exciting journey through the human body and a vivid showcase for some of the fascinating data and imagery generated by the Human Reference Atlas (HRA). After a brief homage to some of the great anatomical drawings of the past, our journey begins at the level of the adult human body. From there, we move through increasing levels of magnification—zooming in by powers of 10—to view the anatomical structures, functional tissue units, cells, organelles, ribosomes, and amino acid chains that become visible at each new level. As we move to magnification strengths that have only recently become technologically possible, the human anatomy we encounter appears even more strange and wondrous. In the end, we zoom back out to the familiar body view, but we arrive there with an awareness of the amazing worlds that exist within the multiscale human body.

# Data

## Early Anatomical Drawings

[Anatomical images](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1wgK6cJWuPYzvcREmwT7O8XKep8pMsjnS) from the *Notebooks of Leonardo da Vinci*.

## FTU Images

[Extracted images](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1U59da-zREHxIQsuy1CMMXTsmOgSiymjB) from the multipanel National Library of Medicine (NLM) publications. 

## 2D FTUs

A functional tissue unit (FTU) is the smallest tissue organization that performs a unique physiologic function and is replicated multiple times in a whole organ. Functional tissue unit illustrations may be used to explore cell type populations by gene, protein, and lipid biomarkers in the Functional Tissue Unit Explorer app. The 2D FTUs can be found at the [HRA website](https://humanatlas.io/2d-ftu-illustrations?releaseVersion=2.3).

## 3D GLB Files

The HRA 3D Reference Object Library provides anatomically correct reference organs. The organs are developed by 3D medical illustrators and approved by subject matter experts for organs. The organs can be downloaded from the [HRA Portal](https://humanatlas.io/3d-reference-library) in the [GLB format](https://www.khronos.org/gltf).


# Code

## FTU Images Extraction

Parsed NLM publications and extracted 821,642 images related to [22 FTUs](https://humanatlas.io/2d-ftu-illustrations). Vision LLM was used to classify images into
- statistical images
- microscopy images
- schematics images
- 3D structure diagrams
- chemical structure diagrams
- mathematical expressions

These multipanel images were then separated into around 400k single pane images using a simple Canny algorithm of edge and contour detection using OpenCV library. The code for this is available at this [Github](https://github.com/cns-iu/cns-humanexus-2.0/tree/main/2.PubMed%20Extract%20Script). These images were later used to create visualizations and animations of Spheres ([Code](https://github.com/cns-iu/cns-humanexus-2.0)), Mosaics ([Code](https://github.com/cns-iu/cns-humanexus-2.0/tree/main/3b-Mosaic)), and a grid ([Code](https://github.com/cns-iu/cns-humanexus-2.0/tree/main/3a-Grid)).

## NLM Book Images

*Hidden Treasure: The National Library of Medicine* contains images along with information from where they are sourced by artists around the world throughout decades. These images were extracted and used for telling a story in this project about human body evolution. You can find the [code for the script here](https://github.com/cns-iu/cns-humanexus-2.0/tree/main/1.NLM_extract_script).

## Images of the Week

HuBMAP (The Human Biomolecular Atlas Program) features an image each week from one of their funded research groups. Three images, all from 2025, appear in the animation:
1. The [3D map](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1h5KcDTwdarBs7bNgf_staNMSKB1N_8kg) of multiscalar neurovascular connections between nephrons of the human kidney across the lifespan from Dr.Sanjay Jain and Dr. Gloria Pryhuber.
2. The 3D, 50x light sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) [image](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1h5KcDTwdarBs7bNgf_staNMSKB1N_8kg) of an adult human kidney cortex from Dr. Sanjay Jain and Liam McLaughlin.
3. The CODEX [image](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1h5KcDTwdarBs7bNgf_staNMSKB1N_8kg) of the small intestine from Joanna Bi and Dr. Bei Wei.

## HRA Pop Helios

The 3d HRA Pop Helios animation was done using open access data from GTEx v9 release from the project named “Adult GTEx” -> “Single cell.” This data can be downloaded from the [GTEx Portal](https://gtexportal.org/home/downloads/adult-gtex/single_cell). Currently, we are using GTEx 8 tissues snRNA-Seq Data. The program basically creates a k-nearest neighbors network for biological data and prepares it to be exported to [Helios-Web](heliosweb.io). This program is accessible at [GitHub](https://github.com/cns-iu/hra-pop-helios). It comes along with a README file with detailed instructions on how to access the data and follow the steps to get the 3D model.
