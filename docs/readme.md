# Overview

This short animation is both an exciting journey through the human body and a vivid showcase for some of the fascinating data and imagery generated by the Human Reference Atlas (HRA). After a brief homage to some of the great anatomical drawings of the past, our journey begins at the level of the adult human body. From there, we move through increasing levels of magnification—zooming in by powers of 10—to view the anatomical structures, functional tissue units, cells, organelles, ribosomes, and amino acid chains that become visible at each new level. As we move to magnification strengths that have only recently become technologically possible, the human anatomy we encounter appears even more strange and wondrous. In the end, we zoom back out to the familiar body view, but we arrive there with an awareness of the amazing worlds that exist within the multiscale human body.
